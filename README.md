# Hi there ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Hi! This project is a simple interpreter for the ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)fuck esoteric language by ivancr72. My goal is to learn how to make interpreters and, eventually, compilers for some other esoteric language, because we obviously need it ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°).
What to keep it mind during this project : it's all for that handsome Lenny.

## Files

For now, there is only a python interpreter pending.
